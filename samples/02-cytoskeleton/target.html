        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        The cytoskeleton is a complex thread-like network of fibrous proteins that spans the cytoplasm. It provides an internal scaffolding and is responsible for maintaining cell structure, resisting mechanical forces, and anchoring organelles. The cytoskeleton also forms tracks for substance transport within the cell, guides cell division and is essential for cell motion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cytoskeleton is made up of three main types of filaments:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microfilaments</strong> are the thinnest filaments. They are made of actin and are located below the cell membrane and throughout the cytoplasm.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate filaments</strong> can be made of keratin, lamin or other proteins. They are found in the cytoplasm and inside the nuclear envelope.</li>
        <li><strong>Microtubules</strong> are the thickest filaments and are made of tubulin. Most microtubules originate from the centrosome and span the entire cell, while others originate from the basal bodies and form the axoneme, which is the core of cilia and flagella.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Cytoskeletal filaments form the core of cellular extensions, which are appendages that protrude from the surface of the cell. They include <strong>microvilli</strong> (short fingerlike non-motile projections), <strong>cilia</strong> (non-motile and motile hairlike structures) and <strong>flagella</strong> (long motile structures with whiplike movements). Cell extensions are primarily useful for nutrient absorption and cell motion.

        Cellular extensions
    </h3>
    <p>
        Cellular extensions can expand the cell surface area (microvilli) and create motion (cilia, flagella).

          [Cellular extensions]<strong>Microvilli</strong> are supported by a core of actin microfilaments; they expand the cell surface area to facilitate nutrient absorption.<br>Motile <strong>cilia</strong> and <strong>flagella</strong> have a core of microtubules called <strong>axoneme</strong>, organized in 9 peripheral pairs with two individual microtubules in the center (9+2). They originate from the basal bodies, structures located below the cell membrane, and contain nine triplets of microtubules (9+0).<br>In motile cilia and flagella, the interaction between <strong>motor proteins</strong> and microtubules of the axoneme produces movement: cilia sweep fluids and substances along the epithelium, flagella generate whip-like movements to propel the cell.
